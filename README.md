Website-Review
==============
<h>http://www.amtrak.com/home -- I recently used this site to buy tickets. The targeted user is prospective travelers. Their book-and-purchase field is the prominent feature in the homepage. There are some superfluous ads around the periphery of the main info hub but they do no conflict with its purpose. I'd consider this site successful </h>
http://www.stevens.edu/sit/ -- Since we'd discussed NJIT's website flaws, I thought I'd see how our "rival" school Stevens Inst. was faring. Right off, the slideshow strongly touts the university's many positive attributes (tech innovation, student success, etc) in a simplistic but bold (think billboard) way. This is a get "butts in seats" site
http://www.elbowroombrooklyn.com/gallery.html -- I saw this menu pinned to a corkboard and was genuinely curious. At first glance, you can't tell if this site is a restaurant, museum or novelty boutique. The knife/fork logo helps cue you in. It is a very simple and effective design; the links (which answer most questions) are prominent because the site is mostly bare (it's elegant in a way). My only complaint is that the gallery link contains no food pics.
http://www.modells.com/ -- This feels run of the mill and a bit corny. It answers all the questions but there is something uninviting about the site that makes me not want to prolong my visit.
http://www.lynda.com/member.aspx -- Well, our training site is also simplistic. Lots of white space and a simple menu bar so you can get right to the "my courses" tab if you're registered. With Lynda, I'm assuming that people visit with a purpose or have an idea what type of site they're visiting. It's unlikely that someone would know straight off the site's true purpose without being prompted.
